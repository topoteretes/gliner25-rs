//! GLiNER2.5 **boundary**-architecture inference on ONNX Runtime.
//!
//! The boundary architecture enumerates nothing. It proposes a pool of
//! `(start, end)` candidates **shared across all queries**, of constant size
//! (`pool_size`, typically 192), and scores each query/candidate pair. Two
//! auxiliary heads give per-query abstention and an expected mention count.
//!
//! Its spans are **half-open** `[start, end)`, unlike the inclusive ranges of
//! the span architecture in
//! [gliner2-rs](https://github.com/dariofinardi/gliner2-rs). Mixing the two
//! conventions is a silent off-by-one.
//!
//! Schema families live in [`families`], behind a default-on feature.

//! ## Layout
//!
//! | module | what it holds |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`processor`] | prompt construction and tokenization |
//! | [`runtime`] | `ort` helpers, precision selection, export-layout resolution |
//! | [`overlap`] | span overlap policies |
//! | [`boundary`] | the inference engine |
//! | [`relation_decode`] | relation logits -> de-duplicated edges |
//! | [`error`] | diagnosable engine errors |
//!
//! The first four are architecture-agnostic — identical to what the span engine
//! in [gliner2-rs](https://github.com/dariofinardi/gliner2-rs) needs, because
//! gliner2 itself shares them. They live here rather than in a crate of their
//! own: one shared crate would have to be published under a single name and
//! would tie the two repositories' release cadences together, for four modules
//! that change rarely. The cost is that a fix to them lands in two places; the
//! alternative was worse.
//!
//! Note that [`overlap`] works on half-open intervals, which is what this
//! architecture produces natively — the span engine converts its inclusive
//! ranges on the way in.
