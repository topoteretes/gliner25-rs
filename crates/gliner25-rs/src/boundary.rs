//! Engine for the **boundary** architecture (GLiNER2.5).
//!
//! It shares nothing with the span architecture: no exhaustive span
//! enumeration, no `count_lstm`. The model proposes a pool of `(start, end)`
//! candidates **shared across all queries**, of constant size (`pool_size`,
//! typically 192), then assigns a logit to each query/candidate pair.
//!
//! ```text
//! encoder(input_ids, attention_mask) -> last_hidden_state [1,S,H]
//!   +- routed_gather(lhs, word_idx,  word_mask)  -> text_states  [1,L,H]
//!   +- routed_gather(lhs, query_idx, ones)       -> query_states [1,Q,H]
//!   +- routed_gather(lhs, cls_idx,   ones)       -> cls_states   [1,K,H]
//!
//! boundary_head_L{bucket}(text_states, text_mask, query_states, query_mask)
//!   -> cand_indices    [1,Q,C,2]   HALF-OPEN (start, end) pairs
//!   -> pair_logits     [1,Q,C]
//!   -> cand_valid      [1,Q,C]
//!   -> null_logits     [1,Q]       per-query abstention
//!   -> count_log_rates [1,Q]       expected mention count per query
//!
//! classifier(cls_states) -> logits [K]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Length buckets
//!
//! The boundary heads have a **static** `num_words`: `torch.export` specialises
//! it because the candidate-pool builder contains a Python loop over a symbolic
//! dimension. The engine therefore picks the smallest bucket that fits the text
//! and pads with `text_mask = 0`.
//!
//! Masked padding is verified to be transparent: for the same real words,
//! padding to a larger bucket yields the same candidate set and probabilities
//! to within ~5e-06, even with random noise in the padded rows.
//!
//! This costs nothing on disk — a head is under 5 MB against 1.1 GB of encoder —
//! and is an advantage at run time: static shapes are what TensorRT, QNN and
//! IOBinding prefer.
